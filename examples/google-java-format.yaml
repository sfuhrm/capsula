shortSummary: Reformats Java source code to comply with Google Java Style.
longDescription: # long description of package content
- The formatter can act on whole files, on limited lines (--lines), on specific offsets (--offset),
- passing through to standard-out (default) or altered in-place (--replace).
- ""
- "The Google Java Style is described here: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html"
- ""
- To reformat changed lines in a specific patch, use google-java-format-diff.py.
- ""
- "Note: There is no configurability as to the formatter's algorithm for formatting. This is a deliberate design decision to unify our code - formatting on a single format."
